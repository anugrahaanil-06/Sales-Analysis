COFFEE SALES DATA ANALYSIS

Overview:-

This project provides an end-to-end analysis of coffee shop sales data using Python, Power BI, and Excel.
It demonstrates how data-driven insights can be used to improve business performance, identify sales trends, and optimize product offerings.

The dataset includes transactions from March to July 2024, capturing details like:

*Date and Time of purchase

*Coffee type

*Payment mode

*Transaction amount

Using this data, I created interactive dashboards and visual reports that uncover key patterns in sales behavior.

Project Objectives:-

*Analyze sales performance over time (monthly & hourly trends).

*Identify top-selling coffee types and peak sales hours.

*Compare revenue contributions from different products.

*Understand customer payment behavior (Card vs Cash).

*Build interactive dashboards for data-driven business decisions.

Key Insights:-

*Americano with Milk and Latte are the most popular coffee types.

*Sales peak between 10 AM and 5 PM, especially around lunchtime.

*Card payments dominate transactions, accounting for over 90% of sales.

*May and June recorded the highest total revenue.

*Opportunities exist to promote low-selling products like Cortado and Espresso.

Tools & Technologies:-

Python - (Pandas, Matplotlib)	Data cleaning, transformation, and trend analysis
Power BI Desktop - Interactive visualization and dashboard creation
Microsoft Excel -	Comparative dashboard and initial data exploration
GitHub - Project documentation and version control

Python Notebook:-

The Python notebook includes:

*Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

*EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

*Revenue trend plots

*Time-based sales analysis

*Correlation analysis among sales parameters

Business Recommendations:-

*Introduce combo offers for popular coffee types (Latte, Americano with Milk).

*Offer time-based discounts during low-sales hours to increase volume.

*Promote cashless offers since most payments are digital.

*Use seasonal campaigns during high-revenue months to maximize profits.
